# Elke.photos portfolio site

The current version is 1.0. There are some older versions but the current site is a complete rewrite from scratch. It's the photo portfolio site for my second job as an event, wedding, photoshoot and party photographer. I used this site as a basis to enhance my Angular and Typescript skills while also learning more stuff like Sass.

## Technologies

* Angular 5 (project generated via the Angular CLI)
* HTML 5
* Bootstrap 4
* Sass
* Typescript 2.4
* Jasmine unit testing framework
* JSON as a temporary data storage

## Future versions

Currently I'm focusing on bugfixing the application. Once the application is stable enough, I can focus on keeping the content up-to-date and writing my own backend. As a temporary solution, all data comes from JSON files to generate the pages and photos. I'd like to write a .Net Core backend in a future release.
